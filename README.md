# microservices

The rise of microservices has been a remarkable advancement in application development and deployment. With microservices, an application is developed, or refactored, into separate services that “speak” to one another in a well-defined way –via APIs, for instance. Each microservice is self-contained, each maintains its own data store (which has significant implications), and each can be updated independently of others.

Moving to a microservices-based approach makes app development faster and easier to manage, requiring fewer people to implement more new features. Changes can be made and deployed faster and easier. An application designed as a collection of microservices is easier to run on multiple servers with load balancing, making it easy to handle demand spikes and steady increases in demand over time, while reducing downtime caused by hardware or software problems.
